Navbar in React

Goal

The goal is to create an basic navbar application without dropdown and other function.

npm start

I created react app with name navbar and started my project with npm start.

I created App file where I import Navbar, before that I created Navbar file where I created state for clicked. I created navbar menu, where I used Link for React and used icon for the react. After that I created unordered HTML list, for that I used Link for all links like home, services. products, contact us, sign up. And I created function for click. I also added style for that navbar.
